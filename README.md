I wanted to build a client server application capable of handling multiple client conversations simultaneously. So I built a pair of multi-threaded servers that accept input from multiple clients and return the appropriate output. In addition to the basic client server model, I also wanted to implement a secondary administration channel to my servers and manually maintain the state of all the conversations within my distributed application. Each aspect of the specifications required me to solve a particular client server problem while maintaining a conversation within a stateless protocol.
